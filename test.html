<h1>Chapter 1: Introduction to Computer Systems</h1>

<h2>1.1 What is a Computer System?</h2>
<p>A computer system is a collection of hardware and software components that work together to perform tasks. It accepts data (input), processes it, and produces information (output).</p>

<h3>Key Components:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Hardware:</strong> The physical parts of the computer, such as the CPU, memory, and storage devices.</li>
    <li><strong>Software:</strong> The set of instructions that tell the hardware what to do, including operating systems and applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Data:</strong> Raw facts and figures that are processed by the computer.</li>
    <li><strong>Users:</strong> People who interact with the computer system.</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.2 Hardware Components</h2>
<p>Understanding the core hardware components is crucial for system functionality.</p>

<h3>CPU (Central Processing Unit):</h3>
<p>The "brain" of the computer, responsible for executing instructions. Key characteristics include clock speed (GHz) and number of cores.</p>

<h3>Memory (RAM - Random Access Memory):</h3>
<p>Volatile storage used to hold data and instructions that the CPU is currently using.  Faster than storage but loses data when power is off.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>DRAM (Dynamic RAM):</strong> Commonly used type of RAM.</li>
    <li><strong>SRAM (Static RAM):</strong> Faster and more expensive than DRAM, used in CPU caches.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Storage Devices:</h3>
<p>Non-volatile storage used to store data permanently.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>HDD (Hard Disk Drive):</strong> Mechanical storage device using spinning platters.</li>
    <li><strong>SSD (Solid State Drive):</strong>  Faster and more reliable than HDD, using flash memory.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Input/Output Devices:</h3>
<p>Devices that allow the computer to interact with the outside world.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Input:</strong> Keyboard, mouse, scanner</li>
    <li><strong>Output:</strong> Monitor, printer, speakers</li>
</ul>

<h2>1.3 Software Components</h2>
<p>Software provides the instructions for the hardware to execute.</p>

<h3>Operating System (OS):</h3>
<p>Manages hardware resources and provides a platform for applications to run. Examples include Windows, macOS, and Linux.</p>

<h3>Application Software:</h3>
<p>Programs designed to perform specific tasks, such as word processing, web browsing, or gaming.</p>

<h3>System Software:</h3>
<p>Utilities that help manage and maintain the computer system, such as antivirus software and disk defragmenters.</p>

<h2>1.4 Number Systems (Binary, Decimal, Hexadecimal)</h2>
<p>Computers use binary (base-2) to represent data. Understanding different number systems is essential for low-level programming and data representation.</p>

<h3>Binary (Base-2):</h3>
<p>Uses only two digits: 0 and 1.</p>

<h3>Decimal (Base-10):</h3>
<p>The number system we use in everyday life, using digits 0-9.</p>

<h3>Hexadecimal (Base-16):</h3>
<p>Uses digits 0-9 and letters A-F (A=10, B=11, C=12, D=13, E=14, F=15). Commonly used for representing memory addresses and colors.</p>

<h3>Conversion Examples:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Decimal 10 = Binary 1010</li>
    <li>Decimal 15 = Hexadecimal F</li>
</ul>

<h1>Chapter 2: Operating Systems</h1>

<h2>2.1 What is an Operating System?</h2>
<p>An operating system (OS) is system software that manages computer hardware and software resources and provides common services for computer programs.</p>

<h3>Key Functions:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Allocating resources like CPU time, memory, and I/O devices to different programs.</li>
    <li><strong>Process Management:</strong> Creating, scheduling, and terminating processes.</li>
    <li><strong>Memory Management:</strong> Managing memory allocation and deallocation.</li>
    <li><strong>File System Management:</strong> Organizing and managing files and directories.</li>
    <li><strong>User Interface:</strong> Providing a way for users to interact with the computer.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.2 Types of Operating Systems</h2>
<p>Different OS types cater to various needs.</p>

<h3>Batch Operating System:</h3>
<p>Processes jobs in batches without user interaction.  Efficient for repetitive tasks.</p>

<h3>Time-Sharing Operating System:</h3>
<p>Allows multiple users to share the computer's resources simultaneously, providing interactive sessions.</p>

<h3>Real-Time Operating System (RTOS):</h3>
<p>Designed for applications that require immediate responses, such as industrial control systems and medical devices.</p>

<h3>Distributed Operating System:</h3>
<p>Manages a network of computers as a single system.</p>

<h2>2.3 Process Management</h2>
<p>Managing processes efficiently is critical for OS performance.</p>

<h3>Process States:</h3>
<ul>
    <li><strong>New:</strong> Process is being created.</li>
    <li><strong>Ready:</strong> Process is waiting to be assigned to the CPU.</li>
    <li><strong>Running:</strong> Process is currently being executed by the CPU.</li>
    <li><strong>Waiting:</strong> Process is waiting for an event to occur (e.g., I/O completion).</li>
    <li><strong>Terminated:</strong> Process has finished execution.</li>
</ul>

<h3>Process Scheduling Algorithms:</h3>
<p>Algorithms used to determine which process to run next.</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong>First-Come, First-Served (FCFS):</strong> Processes are executed in the order they arrive.</li>
    <li><strong>Shortest Job First (SJF):</strong> Processes with the shortest execution time are executed first.</li>
    <li><strong>Priority Scheduling:</strong> Processes are assigned priorities, and higher priority processes are executed first.</li>
    <li><strong>Round Robin:</strong> Each process is given a fixed time slice, and processes are executed in a circular fashion.</li>
</ul>

<h2>2.4 Memory Management</h2>
<p>Efficiently managing memory is vital for preventing system slowdowns.</p>

<h3>Virtual Memory:</h3>
<p>Technique that allows a computer to use more memory than is physically available by swapping portions of memory to disk.</p>

<h3>Paging:</h3>
<p>Dividing memory into fixed-size blocks called pages.</p>

<h3>Segmentation:</h3>
<p>Dividing memory into logical units called segments.</p>
